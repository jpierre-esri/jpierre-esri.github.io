# Homepage

This is a minimal static homepage scaffold you can use for a GitHub Pages site.

Files:

- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — site styles

Quick local preview (Python):

```powershell
# From the homepage folder
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000
```

Deploy options:

1. Repository named `USERNAME.github.io` — push to `main` and the site will be served at `https://USERNAME.github.io`.
2. Use GitHub Pages from the `gh-pages` branch or `docs/` folder — enable in repo settings.

Replace placeholder content (name, links, avatar) with your details. If you want, I can initialize a git repo and create a remote and help push it to GitHub.
